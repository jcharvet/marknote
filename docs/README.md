## Getting Started
1. **Install Python 3.9+** and ensure you are on Windows 11.
2. **Clone or download this repository.**
3. **Run the app:**
   - Double-click `start.bat` (recommended) or run it from a terminal. This will:
     - Activate the virtual environment (if present)
     - Install/update dependencies automatically
     - Launch Marknote

## How to Use Marknote for Note Taking
### Basic Editing
- Type Markdown notes in the left editor pane. The right pane shows a live preview.
- Use the toolbar for New, Open, Save, and insert Markdown links.
- Keyboard shortcuts are available for common actions.

### AI Features
#### Accessing AI
- Open the AI Command Bar:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`, or
  - Click the AI button on the toolbar, or
  - Right-click in the editor and select "AI Command (Natural Language)" from the context menu.
- A larger, multi-line input will appear at the bottom.

#### Using AI Commands
- Type a natural language command, e.g.:
  - `Summarize the highlighted text`
  - `Expand this point into a paragraph`
  - `Refine the selected text`
  - `Analyze the document`
- Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click **Send** to submit.
- If text is selected, the AI will act on it; otherwise, it will use the full document.
- **Result:** The AI's response will always be appended to the end of your note for easy review and editing.

#### Quick AI Access
- Use the context menu or toolbar for fast access to AI features.
- All AI interactions are context-aware and designed for intuitive note-taking.

## Requirements
- Windows 11
- Python 3.9+
