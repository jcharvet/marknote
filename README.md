# Marknote

A Python-based Markdown editor with AI integration (Google Gemini), built with PyQt6.

**Now supports Windows 11 and Linux (tested on Linux Mint/Ubuntu)!**

## Features
- Sidebar document library with folder tree, search, and instant file switching
- Create folders for organizing notes and documentation
- Split-screen Markdown editing and live preview
- Syntax highlighting with QScintilla
- Modern dark UI
- AI-powered suggestions, summarization, and content generation
- Efficient workflow with toolbar, context menu, and keyboard shortcuts

## Coming Soon
- Right-click context menu for files/folders (rename, delete, move)
- Drag-and-drop support for moving files and folders
- More file operations for better note management

## Getting Started
1. **Install Python 3.9+** on your system.
2. **Clone or download this repository.**
3. **Run the app:**
   - **On Windows:** Double-click `start.bat` (recommended) or run it from a terminal. This will:
     - Activate the virtual environment (if present)
     - Install/update dependencies automatically
     - Launch Marknote
   - **On Linux:** Run the `start.sh` script from a terminal:
     ```bash
     ./start.sh
     ```
     The script will check for required Qt system libraries and suggest installable packages if needed.


## How to Use Marknote for Note Taking
### Basic Editing
- Type Markdown notes in the left editor pane. The right pane shows a live preview.
- Use the toolbar for New, Open, Save, and insert Markdown links.
- Keyboard shortcuts are available for common actions.

### AI Features
#### Accessing AI
- Open the AI Command Bar:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`, or
  - Click the AI button on the toolbar, or
  - Right-click in the editor and select "AI Command (Natural Language)" from the context menu.
- A larger, multi-line input will appear at the bottom.

#### Using AI Commands
- Type a natural language command, e.g.:
  - `Summarize the highlighted text`
  - `Expand this point into a paragraph`
  - `Refine the selected text`
  - `Analyze the document`
- Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click **Send** to submit.
- If text is selected, the AI will act on it; otherwise, it will use the full document.
- **Result:** The AI's response will always be appended to the end of your note for easy review and editing.

#### Quick AI Access
- Use the context menu or toolbar for fast access to AI features.
- All AI interactions are context-aware and designed for intuitive note-taking.

## Requirements
- Windows 11 or Linux (Mint/Ubuntu recommended)
- Python 3.9+

## AI Integration
- Uses the Gemini API for AI-powered features. No Genkit installation requiredâ€”just an API key!

## Linux Notes
- Marknote now supports Linux! 
- On first run, the app will check for required Qt system libraries and suggest installable packages if needed.
- To start the app on Linux, use the provided `start.sh` script:
  ```bash
  ./start.sh
  ```
- If you encounter missing library errors, follow the on-screen instructions to install dependencies.

## Cross-Platform Support
- Marknote was originally designed for Windows but now has improved support for Linux.
- Path handling and configuration are normalized for your OS. If you find any issues or have suggestions for better cross-platform compatibility, please open an issue or pull request!

### How to Get Your Gemini API Key

2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on "Create API key" and follow the prompts.
4. Copy your API key.
5. Paste it into `config.json` in the project root (replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`):
   ```json
   {
     "GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
   }
   ```
6. **Security:** Do NOT share or commit your API key publicly.

## Workflow Improvements
- `start.bat` handles venv activation and dependency installation automatically.
- All dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.
- See `plan.md` for technical details and future roadmap.

## Troubleshooting (Linux: PyQt/Qt Errors)
If you encounter errors like:

```
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.
```

This means some required system libraries for PyQt/Qt are missing on your system. To resolve this, install the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xinput0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 libgl1 libegl1 mesa-utils libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If you see errors about missing 'venv' or 'ensurepip', also run:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

After installing, re-run `./start.sh`.

If you are on a different Linux distribution, use your package manager to install the equivalent libraries.
